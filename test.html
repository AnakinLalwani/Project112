My website can recognise balls, bottles, guitars, dogs and books. Objects that have been trained into it work 60% of the time. I used 3 objects and it didnt recognise 1 of them. This is because my Ai has only been trained with some specific objects</h3>

        <h3 class="col-md-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 obsconclusion">MobileNet:<br> MobileNet can identify most of the times but in my testing I had to use 3 different items and it didn't recognise 2 of them correctly I had used a Nerf Gun and a Piano but it gave different answers each time. This is probabaly because all objects are different and the MobileNet has been trained with different images.</h3>
